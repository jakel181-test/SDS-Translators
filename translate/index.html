      <p>Would you like to help translate the SDS?</p>
      <p>Fantastic! Here are some instructions:</p>
      <p>To start, fill in the language you are translating and your username.</p>
      <p>Then, simply type in the translation of each part into the text box below it.</p>
      <p>Once you start typing, a new section labeled "Result" should appear at the bottom of the page.</p>
      <br/>
      <b><p>If you have a Github account:</p></b>
      <p>Once you are done translating all of the parts, open this link in a new tab: <a href="https://github.com/scratchdesignstudio/info#fork-destination-box">Fork the info repository</a></p>
      <p>Now you have two options: </p>
      <p>a) Make a .txt file containing the result in your fork </p>
      <p>b) Directly add the result into the l10n.js file</p>
      <br/>
      <b><p>If you do not have a Github account:</p></b>
      <p>Once you are done translating all of the parts, put the result into a .txt file.</p>
      <p>Make sure that we can get to the .txt file by sharing on a platform such as Google Drive or pastebin</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b><p>Please make sure that you copy the translation exactly!</p></b>
      <p>Now all you need to do is contact <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/jakel181/">@jakel181</a>, and leave a link to your translation!</p>
      <p>Thanks for helping out!</p>
      <p><em>Please note that all translations will be released under the MIT license (it's similar to what Scratch uses for projects - remixes are OK, but you have to give credit)</em></p>

      <p>Year 3000 Have you ever wondered what life might be like in the year 3000? Here is your chance to share your dreams and wishes for the future! In this Scratch Design Studio, create a project that takes us to the future as imagined by YOU! What do you hope food will be like? What do you wish transportation will be like in the year 3000? What do you hope for the world or your community? How will we communicate? How will we dance? </p>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>Need some additional ideas to get started? Try out some of these:
 - Create an interactive map of what a city in the year 3000 might look like 
 - Invent a new tool that will be used in the year 3000 and make an animation about it
 - Share an animation about what you hope the world will be like in 3000
 - Make a dress-up game showing fashion in the year 3000

Remember, you aren’t limited to these ideas. We encourage you to be creative!</p>
